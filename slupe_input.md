Good questions! Let me address both:

## About Vitest and beforeEach/afterEach

In Vitest (and most test frameworks), `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks **always run** regardless of whether you're running:
- A single test with `-t="simple_fails"`
- All tests in the file
- The entire test suite

So the setup/cleanup code is definitely running in all cases. The test structure ensures each test gets its own:
- Fresh `testRepoPath` (from `beforeEach`)
- Cleanup of that path (from `afterEach`)

## About ensuring clipboard write completes

Yes, I think you're absolutely right! The clipboard write might be async, and we're not verifying it completed before starting the monitor. This could cause race conditions where:
1. We call `clipboard.write(uniqueContent)`
2. We immediately start the monitor (which reads clipboard)
3. The monitor might read the old clipboard content if the write hasn't completed yet

Let's add a polling verification after writing the unique content:

```sh nesl
#!nesl [@three-char-SHA-256: w2z]
action = "file_replace_text"
path = "/Users/stuart/repos/slupe/proj/comp/listener/test/unit/clipboard.test.ts"
old_text = <<'EOT_w2z'
      // Write unique content BEFORE starting monitor
      const uniqueContent = `unique-${testCase.name}-${Date.now()}`;
      console.log(`[TEST ${testCase.name}] Writing unique content before monitor start:`, uniqueContent);
      await clipboard.write(uniqueContent);
EOT_w2z
new_text = <<'EOT_w2z'
      // Write unique content BEFORE starting monitor
      const uniqueContent = `unique-${testCase.name}-${Date.now()}`;
      console.log(`[TEST ${testCase.name}] Writing unique content before monitor start:`, uniqueContent);
      await clipboard.write(uniqueContent);
      
      // Poll to ensure clipboard write completed
      let writeVerified = false;
      for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) { // max 500ms
        const current = await clipboard.read();
        if (current === uniqueContent) {
          writeVerified = true;
          console.log(`[TEST ${testCase.name}] Clipboard write verified after ${i * 10}ms`);
          break;
        }
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10));
      }
      if (!writeVerified) {
        throw new Error(`Failed to verify clipboard write of unique content`);
      }
EOT_w2z
#!end_w2z
```

This polling approach ensures:
1. The clipboard write has actually completed
2. The monitor will see the unique content as pre-existing when it starts
3. We have clear logging to debug any issues

This should eliminate any race condition between writing the unique content and starting the monitor.
