Yes and no. We've identified the main issue - the 500ms debounce in the CLI - and reduced it to 200ms by default. But for a tool that's supposed to feel instant, even 200ms is noticeable. Here's what I think:

**Good:**
- Found the bottleneck (500ms debounce in CLI)
- Made debounce configurable via env var and config
- The actual processing is very fast (~5-15ms)
- File watching with `fs.watch` is instant

**Still concerning:**
- Even 100ms debounce (the minimum) adds noticeable lag
- You're experiencing 3 second delays, which means there's another issue

**Recommendations:**

1. **Lower the minimum debounce** - 100ms minimum is arbitrary. For local file watching, 50ms or even 25ms would be fine:

```sh nesl
#!nesl [@three-char-SHA-256: v8c]
action = "file_replace_text"
path = "/Users/stuart/repos/slupe/proj/comp/listener/src/listener.ts"
old_text = <<'EOT_v8c'
  if (config.debounceMs !== undefined && config.debounceMs < 100) {
    throw new Error('listener: debounceMs must be at least 100');
  }
EOT_v8c
new_text = <<'EOT_v8c'
  if (config.debounceMs !== undefined && config.debounceMs < 25) {
    throw new Error('listener: debounceMs must be at least 25');
  }
EOT_v8c
#!end_v8c
```

2. **Default to 50ms in CLI for snappier feel**:

```sh nesl
#!nesl [@three-char-SHA-256: w9d]
action = "file_replace_text"
path = "/Users/stuart/repos/slupe/proj/src/index.ts"
old_text = <<'EOT_w9d'
  const debounceMs = config['debounce_ms'] || parseInt(process.env.SLUPE_DEBOUNCE || '200', 10);
EOT_w9d
new_text = <<'EOT_w9d'
  const debounceMs = config['debounce_ms'] || parseInt(process.env.SLUPE_DEBOUNCE || '50', 10);
EOT_w9d
#!end_w9d
```

3. **Run with timing to see where 3 seconds is coming from**:

```bash
SLUPE_DEBOUNCE=50 node --trace-warnings -r source-map-support/register proj/src/index.ts
```

Try these changes and see if it feels more responsive. If you're still getting 3 second delays, there might be an issue with your editor's save mechanism or file system events.
