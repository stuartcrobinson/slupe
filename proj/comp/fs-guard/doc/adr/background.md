I'd like to read these files to better understand the current architecture and security implications:

Let me analyze the security considerations for file system permissions and tool allowlisting:

## Core Security Concerns

1. **File System Access**
   - Currently: Full filesystem access (no restrictions)
   - Risk: LLM could access/modify sensitive files (`.ssh/`, `/etc/`, system files)
   - Need: Path-based allow/deny lists

2. **Command Execution** 
   - Currently: Unrestricted `exec` with any command
   - Risk: System compromise via shell commands
   - Need: Command/language allowlisting

3. **Path Traversal**
   - Currently: No validation against `../` patterns
   - Risk: Escaping intended boundaries
   - Need: Canonical path resolution + validation

## Implementation Strategy

### Option 1: Centralized Security Module
```typescript
// proj/comp/security/
interface SecurityConfig {
  fs: {
    allowPaths: string[]    // ["/tmp", "./project"]
    denyPaths: string[]     // ["/etc", "~/.ssh"]
    allowSymlinks: boolean
  }
  exec: {
    allowedCommands: string[]  // ["node", "python3"]
    allowedLanguages: string[] // ["javascript", "python"]
    denyShellExpansion: boolean
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Per-Component Validation
- Each component (fs-ops, exec) implements own checks
- Configuration in unified-design.yaml
- Risk: Inconsistent implementation

### Option 3: Wrapper Layer
- Security proxy between orch and executors
- Intercepts all operations
- Most flexible but adds complexity

## Key Questions

1. **Configuration Source**: Where should security rules live?
   - `slupe.yml` (per-project)
   - `~/.sluperc` (user-level)
   - Environment variables
   - Hardcoded defaults

2. **Default Policy**: Restrictive or permissive?
   - Restrictive: Whitelist specific paths/commands only
   - Permissive: Blacklist dangerous paths/commands

3. **Override Mechanism**: Should users be able to disable?
   - CLI flag like `--unsafe`?
   - Or always enforced?

4. **Scope**: What's the threat model?
   - Malicious LLM output?
   - Accidental damage?
   - Multi-user environments?

Would you like me to read those files to understand the current implementation details and propose a specific approach?

Looking at the current architecture, here's my analysis of the security implementation needs:

## Current State Analysis

From the code review:
- **No path validation** in fs-ops - all paths accepted
- **No command restrictions** in exec - any command/language allowed
- **Direct filesystem access** - no canonicalization or traversal checks
- **Architecture notes mention** "V2 Future: Path allowlisting" but no current hooks for it

## Critical Security Gaps

1. **Path Traversal**: No protection against `../../../etc/passwd` style attacks
2. **Symlink Following**: Could escape intended boundaries via symlinks
3. **Shell Injection**: exec passes code directly to interpreters
4. **No Resource Limits**: Unbounded file sizes, execution time (only timeout)

## Implementation Approach

I recommend **Option 1: Centralized Security Module** with a validation layer that intercepts at the executor level:

```typescript
// proj/comp/security/src/index.ts
export class SecurityValidator {
  constructor(private config: SecurityConfig) {}
  
  async validatePath(path: string, operation: 'read' | 'write'): Promise<ValidationResult>
  async validateCommand(lang: string, code: string): Promise<ValidationResult>
}
```

### Why Centralized?

1. **Single source of truth** for security rules
2. **Easier to audit** - all validation in one place
3. **Consistent error messages** across components
4. **Can be disabled/mocked for testing**

### Integration Points

Modify executors to validate before operations:

```typescript
// In fs-ops/index.ts
const security = await getSecurityValidator();
const validation = await security.validatePath(path, 'write');
if (!validation.allowed) {
  return { success: false, error: validation.reason };
}
```

## Configuration Strategy

```yaml
# In slupe.yml or ~/.sluperc
security:
  fs:
    mode: allowlist  # or denylist
    allowed:
      - ./project/**
      - /tmp/slupe-**
    denied:
      - **/.git/**
      - **/.ssh/**
    followSymlinks: false
  exec:
    languages:
      python: { allowed: true, version: "3.x" }
      bash: { allowed: false }  # Too dangerous
    maxExecutionTime: 30000
```

## Key Decisions Needed

1. **Default Policy**: I recommend **restrictive by default**
   - Whitelist project directory + /tmp only
   - Require explicit config to access more

2. **Override Mechanism**: 
   - Environment variable `SLUPE_UNSAFE=1` for development
   - But log prominent warnings when active

3. **Path Resolution**:
   - Always resolve to canonical absolute paths
   - Check after resolution against rules
   - Special handling for Windows vs Unix paths

4. **Threat Model**: Primary focus on:
   - Accidental damage (rm -rf /)  
   - Malicious LLM output (jailbreaks)
   - NOT multi-user security (out of scope)

## Implementation Order

1. **Phase 1**: Path validation only
   - Canonical path resolution
   - Basic allow/deny lists
   - Tests with malicious paths

2. **Phase 2**: Command restrictions
   - Language whitelisting
   - Code pattern blocking (optional)

3. **Phase 3**: Resource limits
   - File size limits
   - Memory limits for exec
   - Rate limiting

## Questions to Resolve

1. Should security config live in `slupe.yml` (per-project) or `~/.sluperc` (user-global)?
2. How to handle the Git operations - they need filesystem access outside project?
3. Should we validate at parse time (fail fast) or execution time (better errors)?
4. What about files created by exec commands - track and validate those too?

The biggest risk I see is the **transition period** - existing users may have workflows that break with new restrictions. Consider a migration strategy.

## Round 1: Initial Analysis

### Re-reading Previous Response
My centralized security module approach has merit but lacks depth on:
- How validation integrates with the existing executor pattern
- Performance implications of path validation on every operation
- Whether security should be a separate component or built into executors

### Document Analysis
From `unified-design.yaml`:
- Security section already exists with path validation concepts
- Mentions canonicalization requirement
- Has allowlist/denylist patterns sketched out
- Notes about race conditions in transaction model

From `orch/doc/ARCH.md`:
- "all fs stuff should immediately be implemented using our fs wrapper functions so this whitelisting/blacklisting is easy to implement"
- Suggests security was always planned at the wrapper level

### Critical Analysis
1. **Integration Point**: The executors are already the choke point - adding security there makes sense
2. **Performance**: Path validation is cheap compared to file I/O
3. **Race Conditions**: The docs mention git transaction race conditions - security checks add another timing window

### Self Reflection
I oversimplified by suggesting a separate security module. The architecture already hints at security being part of the fs wrapper layer.

## Round 2: Deeper Investigation

### Re-reading with New Perspective
The fs-ops component already has all operations flowing through `executeFileOperation`. This is the natural security injection point.

### Document Deep Dive
From `unified-design.yaml` security section:
```yaml
canonicalization: required  # Resolve ../ and symlinks before checking
```
This implies symlink resolution must happen before validation.

The `exec` tool has interesting constraints:
- `lang: {type: enum, values: [python, javascript, bash]}`
- Already limits languages at the schema level

### Critical Analysis
1. **Symlink Complexity**: Following symlinks before validation could itself be an attack vector
2. **Exec Security**: The language enum provides natural restriction point
3. **Path Patterns**: The `**/.git/**` syntax suggests glob pattern matching

### Self Reflection on Search Results
The gemini-cli issue confirms the TOCTOU vulnerability with symlinks - we must resolve paths before validation, not after. This validates my concern about symlink complexity.

## Round 3: Implementation Strategy

### Re-reading with Security Focus
The existing architecture expects security at the fs wrapper level. The ARCH.md note about "fs wrapper functions" confirms this was always the plan.

### Critical Security Analysis
1. **Path Validation Order**: Must be resolve → validate → operate
2. **Symlink Policy**: Should we follow symlinks at all? Or reject operations on symlinks?
3. **Exec Sandboxing**: Language restrictions insufficient - need to prevent filesystem access from executed code

### Self Reflection on Exec Security
Node.js doesn't provide sandboxing mechanisms - isolation requires OS-level features like containers or Linux namespaces. The search confirms exec sandboxing is complex and out of scope for v1.

## Executive Decisions on Uncertainties

### 1. Configuration Source
**Decision**: Security config lives in `slupe.yml` (per-project), with hardcoded secure defaults.
**Rationale**: Project-specific security boundaries make sense. No global config reduces complexity.

### 2. Symlink Policy
**Decision**: Resolve symlinks with `fs.realpath()` before validation, but add a `followSymlinks: false` option.
**Rationale**: The TOCTOU vulnerability requires resolving before checking. Option allows stricter security.

### 3. Default Policy
**Decision**: Restrictive by default - only allow project directory and `/tmp/slupe-*`.
**Rationale**: Security-first approach. Users must explicitly expand access.

### 4. Path Resolution Implementation
**Decision**: Validate at execution time in fs-ops, not parse time.
**Rationale**: Better error messages, cleaner separation of concerns.

### 5. Exec Sandboxing
**Decision**: No sandboxing in v1 - document as security limitation.
**Rationale**: Proper sandboxing requires OS-level features beyond Node.js scope.

### 6. Git Operations Access
**Decision**: Git operations bypass path restrictions when executed via hooks.
**Rationale**: Git needs repository-wide access. Hooks are trusted configuration.

### 7. Override Mechanism
**Decision**: `SLUPE_UNSAFE=1` environment variable with loud warnings.
**Rationale**: Escape hatch for development, but makes security bypass explicit.

## Final Implementation Plan

### Security Module Structure
```typescript
// proj/comp/security/src/index.ts
export interface SecurityConfig {
  fs: {
    mode: 'allowlist' | 'denylist';
    allowed: string[];
    denied: string[];
    followSymlinks: boolean;
  };
  exec: {
    languages: {
      python: boolean;
      javascript: boolean;
      bash: boolean;
    };
    maxExecutionTime: number;
  };
}

export class PathValidator {
  async validatePath(path: string, operation: 'read' | 'write'): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    // 1. Resolve to canonical path
    const resolved = await fs.realpath(path).catch(() => path);
    
    // 2. Check against rules
    if (this.config.fs.mode === 'allowlist') {
      return this.checkAllowlist(resolved);
    } else {
      return this.checkDenylist(resolved);
    }
  }
}
```

### Integration Points

1. **fs-ops**: Add validation before each operation
```typescript
// In each handler
const validator = getSecurityValidator();
const validation = await validator.validatePath(path, 'write');
if (!validation.allowed) {
  return { success: false, error: validation.reason };
}
```

2. **exec**: Check language whitelist
```typescript
if (!config.exec.languages[lang]) {
  return { success: false, error: `Language '${lang}' not allowed` };
}
```

### Default Security Config
```yaml
security:
  fs:
    mode: allowlist
    allowed:
      - "./**"           # Project directory
      - "/tmp/slupe-**"   # Temporary files
    denied: []         # Empty in allowlist mode
    followSymlinks: false
  exec:
    languages:
      python: true
      javascript: true
      bash: false      # Shell too dangerous
    maxExecutionTime: 30000
```

## Remaining Uncertainties

1. **Performance Impact**: How much overhead does path resolution add? May need caching.
2. **Windows Compatibility**: Path resolution behaves differently on Windows.
3. **Relative Path Handling**: Should we convert relative paths to absolute before validation?
4. **Glob Pattern Matching**: Which glob library for path patterns? minimatch vs micromatch?

## Summary

The security implementation should be a thin validation layer integrated directly into the existing executors. Path validation uses canonical resolution to prevent symlink attacks, with restrictive defaults requiring explicit configuration to expand access. Exec security is limited to language whitelisting - proper sandboxing is explicitly out of scope for v1. The architecture allows future enhancement without breaking changes, and the escape hatch (SLUPE_UNSAFE) provides a development workaround while making security bypasses explicit and logged.
