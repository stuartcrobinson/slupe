**Yes, this solves the delimiter collision problem entirely.**

One-per-line eliminates parsing ambiguity:

```sh nesl
#!nesl [@three-char-SHA-256: rt1]
action = "replace_text_in_structure"
path = "/app/handlers.py"
target = <<'EOT_rt1'
UserAuth
validate
for item in items
if item.valid
EOT_rt1
old_text = "process"
new_text = "handle"
#!end_rt1
```

For markdown:
```sh nesl
#!nesl [@three-char-SHA-256: md1]
action = "replace_text_in_structure"
path = "/docs/guide.md"
target = <<'EOT_md1'
Setup Guide
Installation -> Configuration
Database Setup
EOT_md1
old_text = "MySQL"
new_text = "PostgreSQL"
#!end_md1
```

## Advantages
- **Zero escaping needed** - each line is literal content
- **Unambiguous parsing** - newline is the only delimiter
- **Handles any content** - slashes, arrows, quotes, brackets all fine
- **Natural hierarchy** - indentation could optionally reinforce nesting
- **Consistent across code/markdown** - same syntax pattern

## Potential issues

**Ambiguity resolution still needed:**
```
target = <<'EOT'
UserAuth
validate
for item in items  # Which one? First? Second?
if item.valid
EOT
```

Add occurrence marker:
```
target = <<'EOT'
UserAuth
validate
for item in items [2]  # Second occurrence
if item.valid
EOT
```

**Line break edge case:** What if a heading contains a newline? (Rare but possible in some markdown flavors)

## Assessment

This is cleaner than any delimiter-based approach. The heredoc syntax is already proven for multiline content. LLMs handle line-based formats well. The only remaining design decision is how to mark occurrence numbers for duplicates - suffix like `[2]` or separate field like `occurrence = 2`.

answer to "## Potential issues"



the whole point is we need an approach for the LLM to write.  so it has to be super intuitive and obvious.  natural and easy to remmeber and write.  for an LLM. trust your gut, since you are an LLM.  doing this xpath numeral ordering kinda stuff like `for item in items [2]  # Second occurrence` is a bad idea because that would mean the LLM has to count and LLMs suck at counting.  instead, the LLM just must udnertsand that the parent/child target path must be unique.  and it almost always will be.  class/function parent/child names rarely ahve collisions.

Yes, this feels **really good**. 

When I look at these action names:
- `move_structure_to_file_end`
- `move_structure_before`
- `insert_after_structure`

I immediately know:
1. What each one does
2. What parameters I need
3. No hidden behaviors to remember

The cognitive load is near zero. I don't have to pause and think "wait, what was the convention for file-level again?" 

Each action is a complete thought: `move_structure_to_file_end` - done, that's the whole idea. No parameters that sometimes mean one thing and sometimes mean another.

## The full set feels cohesive:

```js

//FILE BASED

// File operations
write_file(path, content)

read_file(path)
// read_files(paths: string[])      //dont support htis until nesl supports dup params. and then need to change read_files to need dup params instaed of one per line. 

delete_file(path)

move_file(old_path, new_path)

replace_text_in_file(path, old_text, new_text)
replace_all_text_in_file(path, old_text, new_text, count?)

replace_text_range_in_file(path, old_text_beginning, old_text_end, new_text)

append_to_file(path, content)

//STRUCTURE BASED

// Read
read_structure(path, target)
//  read_structures(path, targets[])  //dont support htis until nesl supports dup params. and then need to change read_files to need dup params instaed of one per line. 

// Replace/Delete  
replace_structure(path, target, content)
delete_structure(path, target)

// Modify within
replace_text_in_structure(path, target, old_text, new_text)
replace_all_text_in_structure(path, target, old_text, new_text, count?)

// Insert content around
insert_before_structure(path, target, content)
insert_after_structure(path, target, content)

// Move existing structures
move_structure_before(source_path, source_target, dest_path, dest_target)
move_structure_after(source_path, source_target, dest_path, dest_target)
move_structure_to_file_start(source_path, source_target, dest_path)
move_structure_to_file_end(source_path, source_target, dest_path)
```

Every action name tells me the complete story. This is what I want when I'm generating code - no ambiguity, no special cases, just clear intentions.

**Ship it.** This feels right.
