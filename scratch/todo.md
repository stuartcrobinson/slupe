- call bank ozk
X add file_replace_text_range
- add parsed structure edit actions
https://claude.ai/chat/d8212c32-e2ba-4888-b92d-22875549255d
- make clipboard-input and clipboard-ouput default to true. 
    pring usage notes whenever slupe is run

X fix this output - needs file content for failed match
            === SLUPE RESULTS ===
            fs1 ❌ file_replace_text /Users/stuart/repos/slupe/proj/comp/listener/src/formatters.ts - old_text appears 2 times, must appear exactly once
            fs2 ✅ file_replace_text /Users/stuart/repos/slupe/proj/comp/listener/src/formatters.ts
            === END ===
            === OUTPUTS ===
            === END ===
    - and maybe we sould update instructinos to avoid this somehow. but honestly maybe we should NOT be responding with file content all the time.  LLM knows what the state is. it can focus and be more careful? but that seems crappy too. what we really need is targeted parsed node editing.  then we can pass back stuff all the time. 

X fix files_read so it returns what it can even if some of the reads failed. 





future:

- add cmd line arg to not copy output back to output. .... or maybe we need 2 cmds: --clipboard-input --clipboard-output .... yeah.  default for input is true, default for output is false.  will taht work? can cmd line args have optional parameters? so if missing its treated like "true" ?
- update listener-workflow-v2.test so it doens't need cases to have the entire input when checking the prepended results

- update/fix this error: -- see /Users/stuart/repos/slupe/proj/comp/fs-guard/src/FsGuard.ts
        === SLUPE RESULTS ===
        rd1 ❌ file_read /Users/stuart/repos/slupe/proj/comp/listener/src/index.ts - Read access denied for
        === END ===
    - denied for what? remove "for" maybe
    - list the cwd. (in case slupe running in multiple repos simultaneously)


------------------------
TODO:

X start working in a dev branch?
X need tests for copy/paste stuff.  with that feature on and off. 
X we need to prevent repeat edits/overwrites from happening.  we need a 'log' per sha id and once its successful we should block re-executing it. i think.  cos i just accidentally overwrote a bunch of changes i made.
    X quick fix - just dont apply any changes if the top nonwhitespace text is "=== SLUPE RESULTS ==="
X write e2e tests that dont use copy/paste
X set up the git hooks
X allow cmd line arg and config arg for custom input/output files
    - critical for using npx slupe in actual slupe repo

X squasher !!!

now... 

X fix build errors
X clean up README 

X write hacker news post about it
X publish sunday morning

LATER

what else do i need rn? before publish to HN?

nesl transcription layer? 
    X remove apostrophes after end delimiters 
    X make sure they're on their own line

- build search/replace range action

- ast code... for query / especially debugging, get all the file paths and most relevant functions from the error statements.  then get all the functions connectd to those. like as in graph.  pagerank or whatever.  and inlude those in context. i think thats what aider does maybe. 

wdw doing now ..

- claude is getting bad at reading files from pasted snapshots.  need to inlude some header info about how to process them i think
-----------------

TODO:

- indicate in the unified yaml whether tools are implemented yet or not.  so if not they should be totally ignored from everything. 



ok all things are supposedly finished for release!!!!

so what next...


X review the allowed/exisitng tools/actions
    X clean up fs-ops action handlers
    x rename them to actions? -- mostly done? good enough?
    X drop dumb stuff like 'dir_create'
        X lets thoroughly clean up the unified-design thing.  maybe rip out all the future stuff.  that should go in ... somethign else.
    X NO indicate in the unified yaml whether they're implemented yet or not.  so if not they should be totally ignored from everything. 
        dont do this.  totally pointeless
X exec just isn't working.  need to hardcode that its no supported        
    yes it is.  ... well error formatting is broken...
X fix exec error output
X listener human entry point
X cmd line option for auto copy/paste stuff
X paste file contents in output for failed file edit action
X new feature - listen for LLM output copy?  
    X yes!!!!  be watching the clipboard for when
        X contains nesl AND THEN
            x clipbaord changes within 1 or 2 seconds such that it contains the same nesl markers and ids (note that we cant do an exact match cos formatting syntax might be different from copy button vs select and copy)
            x so u click the copy button, then do ctrl-a, ctrl-v -- to immediately just copy the whole page
            x and this is how sloop will know that the first thing u copied was real nesl syntax that u want to get executed.  
            x no - should we integrate mac notifications?  prob too hard. deal w settings etc
X publish nesl to npm 
X publish slupe to npm 
- look for response from npm support about getting my account back...             
X rename to slupe
- cleanup, just delete trash or embarrassing bits

WHAT TO DO WHILE WAITING FOR NPM ACCESS?

start doing some of this ... maybe in a dev branch now!!!! YES USE DEV BRANCHES NOW 

use npx slupe for stuff now.  wdiw most.... 
- paths support wildcards 
- search replace range

^ those seem easiest to implement and biggest reward rn.  

oh also we need to figure out why cant run node tests from exec command. 


- update all 'path' vars to support wildcard/glob expansion.  
    - maybe have param for all such actions like "dont_support_path_wildcards" or soemthing.  just meniotn it once and then share reminder in error or warning message if there's a real file continaign a * or soemthing
- file_replace_text_range
- file_read_node
- file_overwrite_node
- file_replace_in_node
- file_delete_node_
- file_insert_node_after
- and then something to do like sed using file pattern and regex?
- sd
- rg

- PUBLISH TO HACKER NEWS

v2: add some more tools, like:

- file_replace_in_node
- file_overwrite_node
- file_delete_node

-----

slupe-cli 


FIVE things i want to finish before release 


X LLM instructions generator (based on tools allowlist)

X hooks for custom git etc before and after executions

X fs permissions - read/write allowlist/denylist
X tools allowlist (to block cmd line stuff for file security)


- npx run usage
- settings file slupe.yaml - hooks, fs permissions 

LATER:


- secretly allow synonyms for tools (like file_create == file_write cos llm really wants to use file_create)
    - new feature maybe... synonyms.. (create_file write_file ???? idk if overkill)
    - .  file_create and file_copy  -
- search/replace by range file_replace_text_range
- copy paste mode 
    - include clipboard watcher to automatically execute outputs that have been copied and then if user copies "nesl" 
- git squash stuff
    
----


? slupe init -- create the slupe.yaml file with file permissions based on cwd
    i think this has been done already by claude? 


-----

TODO:

- allow case insensitive tool action names.  too hard to read evyerthing now in LLM raw output

- the error message should also show the intended file path
```
e5f ✅ file_write /Users/stuart/repos/slupe/proj/comp/hooks/src/interpolateCommand.ts
a1b ❌ FILE_WRITE ERROR: Unknown action: FILE_WRITE (line 25)

...

#!nesl [@three-char-SHA-256: a1b]
action = "FILE_WRITE"
path = "/Users/stuart/repos/slupe/proj/comp/hooks/src/formatHookResult.ts"
content = <<'EOT_a1b'
import type { CommandResult, HookResult } from './types.js';
```

---

- tell the LLM about how to read the pasted files snapshot.  it tries to find the specific file then gets confused. waste of time/tokens
```
Let me first check what's currently in the index.ts file and then implement the HooksManager:Analyzed dataView analysisjavascript// Check current index.ts
const indexContent = await window.fs.readFile('/Users/stuart/repos/slupe/proj/comp/hooks/src/index.ts', { encoding: 'utf8' });
console.log("Current index.ts:");
console.log(indexContent);
OutputResult

ErrorError

File not found: No file named "/Users/stuart/repos/slupe/proj/comp/hooks/src/index.ts"Let me check the paste content for the index.ts file. I can see it has the skeleton but no implementation.
```

- the /Users/stuart/repos/slupe/use-listener/test-listener-live.ts script is VERY SLOW TO USE!!! SLOW AT SAVING FILES!!! wtf why??? and i want it to prepend results to the input file AS EACH ITEM SUCCEEDS.  dont wait for the whole thing. and our debug needs more outputs for exec stuff.  show the whole stdout etc

---

claude is really bad at using numbered file reads.  it keeps requesting line ranges for numbered file reads that are totally stupid and terrible.  but then it never actually uses the replace by lines number function anyway.  it thinks about stuff per section.  need to give it that capability in search/repalce

---

future: no fs at all 

the whole point of nice little files is for humans.  w LLM it would be better if entire codebase was in one single file.  and an outline (that visually looked like a fs) was autogenerated based on parsed content.  

all the imports and dependency file locationn and formats is a big source of wasted time and mistakes and cognition.  save a lot of tokens and attention to have everythign in one file.  and the LLM just requests/edits specific nodes/classes/functions.  like... i just spent a lot of time doing a refactor to break all the code for tools/actions into their own files.  cos it feels nicer to me.  but v wasteful now in terms of all the imports that an LLM will have to wade through
